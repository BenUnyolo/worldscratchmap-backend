# WorldScratchMap

A full stack web app where the user can create interactive maps to show countries that they have visited. The [front end](https://github.com/BenUnyolo/worldscratchmap) uses React with Tailwind CSS for styling. On the back end it uses the Python framework Flask, with a MySQL database.
